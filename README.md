# Computer Vision Desktop Application for ASD Students

## Objective
Develop a computer vision desktop application to assist students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving hand-eye coordination and engagement through interactive games.

## Work Done
- **Survey**: Conducted research to identify suitable games for students with ASD.
- **Module 1**: Created a game where students capture balloon images using MediaPipe and OpenCV, with digits displayed for interaction.
- **Module 2**: Developed a shape recognition game where students interact with and identify various shapes on the screen.
- **Module 3**: Implemented a body awareness game using MediaPipe to recognize whole body landmarks, helping students mimic body movements for improved awareness.
- **Platform Integration**: Combined all three modules into a single platform using Tkinter for a seamless end-to-end product.

## Future Scope
- Implement data collection to track student progress and generate improvement reports.
- Expand the range of games and incorporate adaptive difficulty levels for enhanced learning.
